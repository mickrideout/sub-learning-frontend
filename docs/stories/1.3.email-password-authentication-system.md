## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2:
- User model is fully implemented with password_hash field and hashing methods
- Database schema includes all required authentication fields (email, password_hash, oauth_provider, oauth_id)
- SQLAlchemy models follow PascalCase naming (User model in `app/models/user.py`)
- Flask application factory pattern established with proper configuration system
- Project structure follows unified architecture specifications exactly

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Framework**: Flask 2.3.x with Flask-Login for session management
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login 0.6.x for user sessions and social login
- **Frontend Framework**: Vanilla JS + Bootstrap 5.3 for responsive UI without framework overhead
- **State Management**: Browser SessionStorage/LocalStorage for client-side state persistence
- **Backend Language**: Python 3.9+ for server-side application logic
- **Database**: SQLite 3.x with existing User model for authentication storage

### Authentication Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
Authentication blueprint structure:
- Authentication endpoints in `app/blueprints/auth/routes.py`
- OAuth handlers in `app/blueprints/auth/oauth_handlers.py` (for future OAuth story)
- WTForms validation in `app/blueprints/auth/forms.py`
- Business logic in `app/services/auth_service.py`

### Data Models Available
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
User model already implemented with required fields:
- id: INTEGER (Primary Key) - Unique user identifier
- email: VARCHAR(255) - User's email address for login (with uniqueness constraint)
- password_hash: VARCHAR(255) - Securely hashed password using Werkzeug
- oauth_provider: VARCHAR(50) - OAuth provider (google, facebook, apple, null)
- oauth_id: VARCHAR(255) - OAuth provider user ID
- native_language_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to languages table
- target_language_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to languages table
- created_at: DATETIME - Account creation timestamp
- updated_at: DATETIME - Last profile update timestamp
- is_active: BOOLEAN - Account status flag

### API Specifications Required
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
Required authentication endpoints:
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration with email, password, native_language_id, target_language_id
- `POST /auth/login` - User login with email/password credentials
- `POST /auth/logout` - Session cleanup and logout
- `POST /auth/password-reset-request` - Password reset request via email
- `POST /auth/password-reset` - Password reset confirmation

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Authentication component locations:
- Forms: `app/blueprints/auth/forms.py`
- Routes: `app/blueprints/auth/routes.py`
- Business logic: `app/services/auth_service.py`
- Templates: `app/templates/auth/*.html`
- Tests: `tests/test_auth.py`

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
Email/password authentication should integrate with existing OAuth workflow:
- New users need language pair selection after registration
- Session management must be compatible with OAuth flows (future story 1.4)
- Error handling should gracefully fallback between email/password and OAuth methods

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
Authentication JavaScript components:
- Auth module: `app/static/js/modules/auth.js`
- API client integration for authentication endpoints
- State management for user session in browser storage
- Bootstrap modal handling for authentication forms

### Security and Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Critical security rules for authentication:
- **Session Security**: Never store sensitive data in client-side storage - use Flask sessions for authentication state only
- **OAuth State Management**: Always validate OAuth state parameter and store callback URLs in session (for future OAuth integration)
- **Input Sanitization**: Always escape user content in Jinja2 templates and validate all API inputs with WTForms
- **Database Connection Management**: Always use SQLAlchemy context managers or Flask-SQLAlchemy's db.session
- **Error Response Consistency**: All API endpoints must return JSON errors with consistent structure: `{"error": "message", "code": "error_type"}`

### Required Dependencies
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
Additional requirements for requirements.txt:
- Flask-Login (for session management and user state persistence)
- WTForms (for form validation and CSRF protection)
- Flask-WTF (Flask integration for WTForms with CSRF)
- Email-validator (for email validation in forms)

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Authentication blueprint: `app/blueprints/auth/__init__.py`
- Authentication routes: `app/blueprints/auth/routes.py`
- Authentication forms: `app/blueprints/auth/forms.py`
- Authentication service: `app/services/auth_service.py`
- Authentication templates: `app/templates/auth/*.html`
- Authentication tests: `tests/test_auth.py`

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location**: All tests in `tests/` directory
- **Test Framework**: pytest 7.x for backend unit and integration testing
- **Test Configuration**: Use `tests/conftest.py` for pytest configuration and fixtures
- **Test Organization**: Organize tests by component type (models, services, api, integration)

**Specific Requirements for Authentication Story**:
- Test authentication service functions (registration, login, password validation)
- Test authentication routes with valid and invalid inputs
- Test form validation including CSRF protection
- Test session management with Flask-Login decorators
- Test password hashing and verification methods (already tested in User model)
- Test integration between authentication forms and database operations
- Test error handling for duplicate emails, invalid credentials, etc.
- Test basic password reset flow functionality

**Test Organization for This Story**:
```
