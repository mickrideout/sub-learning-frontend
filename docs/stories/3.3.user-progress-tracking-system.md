### Data Models Required
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#userprogress]
**UserProgress Model (Enhanced):**
- id: INTEGER (Primary Key) - Unique progress identifier
- user_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to users table
- sub_link_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to sub_links table (specific translation pair)
- current_alignment_index: INTEGER - Position in the link_data alignment array
- total_alignments_completed: INTEGER - Count of completed alignment pairs
- last_accessed: DATETIME - When user last studied this content
- session_duration_minutes: INTEGER - Time spent in current session

**Progress Data Schema (Frontend):**
```typescript
interface ProgressData {
  sub_link_id: number;
  current_alignment_index: number;
  total_alignments_completed: number;
  completion_percentage: number;
  session_duration_minutes: number;
  last_accessed: string;
}
```

### API Specifications Required
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#progress-tracking-endpoints]

**GET /api/progress/{sub_link_id}:**
- Retrieves existing progress for specific subtitle pair
- Returns 404 if no progress exists (new learning session)
- Includes completion statistics and session history
- Requires user authentication via session cookies

**PUT /api/progress/{sub_link_id}:**
- Updates progress with current position and session data
- Accepts current_alignment_index and session_duration_minutes
- Calculates total_alignments_completed and completion percentage
- Uses database transactions for atomic updates
- Returns updated progress data with statistics

### Frontend Component Enhancements Required
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]

**ProgressTracker Module (New):**
- `app/static/js/modules/progress-tracker.js` - Core progress management
- Automatic progress saving every 5 alignments during navigation
- Session duration tracking with start/pause/resume functionality
- Offline progress queue with retry logic for network failures
- Progress restoration API for learning interface initialization

**Dashboard Components (Enhanced):**
- Recently studied movies component with resume functionality
- Overall progress statistics display with completion counters
- Movie-specific progress bars with percentage completion
- Session history and learning analytics dashboard

**Learning Interface Progress Integration:**
- Real-time progress percentage display in subtitle player
- Visual feedback for milestone achievements (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Automatic progress checkpoint saving during session
- Progress restoration on learning interface load

### Backend Service Architecture Required
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#service-architecture]

**ProgressService Class:**
- `app/services/progress_service.py` - Business logic for progress operations
- Methods: `get_user_progress()`, `update_progress()`, `calculate_completion()`
- Session duration aggregation and analytics calculations
- Progress validation and boundary checking
- Database transaction management for atomic updates

**Progress API Endpoints:**
- `app/blueprints/api/progress.py` - REST API endpoint handlers
- User authentication validation using `@login_required`
- Input validation with WTForms for progress data
- Error handling with consistent JSON response format
- Rate limiting protection for progress update endpoints

### Database Schema Enhancements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
**UserProgress Table (Existing - Verify Structure):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_progress (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    sub_link_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    current_alignment_index INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_alignments_completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    session_duration_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_accessed DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (sub_link_id) REFERENCES sub_links(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE(user_id, sub_link_id)
);
```

**Required Indexes for Performance:**
- `idx_user_progress_user` ON user_progress(user_id)
- `idx_user_progress_link` ON user_progress(sub_link_id)
- `idx_user_progress_accessed` ON user_progress(last_accessed)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Backend Files:**
- Model: `app/models/progress.py` - UserProgress SQLAlchemy model (verify exists)
- Service: `app/services/progress_service.py` - Progress business logic
- API: `app/blueprints/api/progress.py` - Progress REST endpoints
- Migration: `migrations/versions/xxx_enhance_user_progress.py` - Database updates

**Frontend Files:**
- Module: `app/static/js/modules/progress-tracker.js` - Core progress tracking
- Component: `app/static/js/components/progress-indicator.js` - Visual progress displays
- Utility: `app/static/js/utils/storage-helper.js` - Enhanced localStorage management (exists)
- Template: `app/templates/main/dashboard.html` - Dashboard progress sections

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
**Progress Tracking Security:**
- **Authentication Validation**: All progress endpoints require `@login_required` decorator
- **Data Ownership**: Validate user owns progress records before updates
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate alignment indices and duration values
- **Transaction Safety**: Use database transactions for progress updates
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent excessive progress update requests (max 10/min)
- **Session Security**: Never store sensitive progress data in localStorage

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
**Pi Resource Optimization for Progress:**
- **Batch Progress Updates**: Update server every 5 alignments, not every navigation
- **Memory-Conscious Queries**: Never load all user progress at once - use pagination
- **Database Transactions**: Use SQLAlchemy transactions for atomic progress persistence
- **Offline Queue Management**: Store failed progress updates in localStorage queue
- **Cache Progress Data**: Cache current session progress client-side to reduce API calls

### Integration Points
**SubtitlePlayer Integration (From Story 3.2):**
- Extend existing navigation methods to trigger progress updates
- Integrate with auto-play functionality for automatic progress advancement
- Add progress checkpoint saving during session pause/resume
- Connect progress restoration to learning interface initialization

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Add recently studied movies section with progress data
- Create overall learning statistics display
- Implement quick resume functionality for incomplete sessions
- Display progress history and learning analytics

## Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Backend Testing Requirements:**
- **Test File Location**: `tests/test_services/test_progress_service.py`, `tests/test_api/test_progress_endpoints.py`
- **Test Framework**: pytest with fixtures for database setup
- **Test Configuration**: SQLite in-memory database for isolated testing

**Manual Testing Requirements:**
- **Test File Location**: All tests in `manual_tests/` directory organized by feature area
- **Test Framework**: Manual testing checklists for UI validation
- **Test Configuration**: Browser-based testing across desktop and mobile devices

**Specific Testing Requirements for Story 3.3:**
