# Story 2.2: Movie Catalog Display

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** language learner,  
**I want** to browse available movies with subtitle content,  
**so that** I can choose interesting content for my learning sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1:
- User authentication system fully operational with Flask-Login
- User language preferences (native_language_id, target_language_id) stored and accessible
- API blueprint architecture established with REST endpoints
- Service layer pattern implemented for business logic separation
- Bootstrap 5.3 styling framework configured for consistent UI components
- Session-based authentication working for protected routes
- Frontend component architecture established with ES6 classes

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Vanilla JS + Bootstrap 5.3 for movie catalog interface
- **Backend Framework**: Flask 2.3.x with existing blueprint architecture
- **Database**: SQLite with existing sub_titles and sub_links tables
- **State Management**: Browser SessionStorage for movie selection state
- **API Style**: REST endpoints with JSON responses for movie data retrieval

### Data Models Available
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**SubTitle Table Structure:**
- id: INTEGER (Primary Key) - Unique movie identifier
- title: TEXT - Movie title for display and search

**SubLink Table Structure:**
- id: INTEGER (Primary Key) - Unique translation link identifier
- fromid: INTEGER - Source movie ID (references sub_titles.id)
- fromlang: SMALLINT - Source language ID (references languages.id)
- toid: INTEGER - Target movie ID (references sub_titles.id)  
- tolang: SMALLINT - Target language ID (references languages.id)

**User Model Language Fields:**
- native_language_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to languages table
- target_language_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to languages table

### API Specifications Required
[Source: architecture/data-models.md, architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Movie Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/movies` - Get available movies filtered by user's language pair
  - Query filters by user's native_language_id and target_language_id
  - Joins sub_links with sub_titles to return movies with subtitle availability
  - Response: Array of movie objects with id, title, and subtitle availability info
  - Authentication: Requires session-based authentication

### Database Query Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Key database queries for movie catalog:
```sql
-- Get movies available for user's language pair
SELECT DISTINCT st.id, st.title 
FROM sub_titles st
JOIN sub_links sl ON st.id = sl.fromid OR st.id = sl.toid
WHERE (sl.fromlang = ? AND sl.tolang = ?) 
   OR (sl.fromlang = ? AND sl.tolang = ?)
ORDER BY st.title ASC
```

### Frontend Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Movie Discovery Component Location:** `app/static/js/modules/movie-discovery.js`
**Component Architecture Pattern:**
- ES6 class-based component with initialization and API integration
- State management using SessionStorage for movie selection
- Bootstrap integration for responsive list layout
- Error handling with user-friendly messages using existing error-handler utilities

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Movie catalog component locations:
- Route handler: `app/blueprints/main/routes.py` (add movies catalog route)
- Template: `app/templates/main/movies.html`
- API endpoint: `app/blueprints/api/movies.py` (create new API module)
- Frontend component: `app/static/js/modules/movie-discovery.js`
- Service layer: `app/services/content_service.py` (create new content service)

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Movie catalog route: `app/blueprints/main/routes.py`
- Movie catalog template: `app/templates/main/movies.html`
- Movie API endpoints: `app/blueprints/api/movies.py` (new module)
- Movie discovery component: `app/static/js/modules/movie-discovery.js`
- Content service: `app/services/content_service.py` (new service)
- Integration tests: `tests/test_integration/test_movie_catalog.py`

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Critical security rules for movie catalog:
- **Session Security**: Use Flask sessions for movie selection state, validate user authentication
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate movie selection requests to prevent injection attacks
- **Error Response Consistency**: All API endpoints must return JSON errors with consistent structure
- **Database Connection Management**: Always use SQLAlchemy context managers for database queries

### Form Validation Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Movie catalog validation rules:
- Movie selection requests must include valid movie IDs that exist in database
- User must have valid language preferences set before accessing movie catalog
- Movie access must be restricted to movies with available subtitle pairs for user's languages

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#movie-discovery-and-learning-session-start]
Movie catalog integration into user workflow:
1. User accesses movie catalog from dashboard
2. System queries available movies filtered by user's language pair
3. Display movies as scannable list with clear selection indicators
4. User selects movie, system stores selection context
5. Navigation to learning interface (placeholder for Epic 3)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location**: All tests in `tests/` directory with organized subdirectories
- **Test Framework**: pytest 7.x for backend unit and integration testing
- **Test Configuration**: Use `tests/conftest.py` for pytest configuration and fixtures
- **Test Organization**: Organize tests by component type (services, api, integration)

**Specific Requirements for Movie Catalog Story**:
- Test movie API endpoint returns movies filtered by user's language pair
- Test content service filtering logic with various language combinations
- Test movie selection handling and navigation
- Test authentication requirements for movie catalog access
- Test error handling for empty catalogs and database connection issues
- Test responsive layout and Bootstrap component behavior

**Test Organization for This Story**:
```
