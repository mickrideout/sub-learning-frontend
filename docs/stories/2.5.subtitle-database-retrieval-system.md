### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Framework**: Flask 2.3.x with API blueprint for subtitle endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite with existing SubLine table for subtitle content storage
- **Caching**: Python in-memory caching (dict-based) with optional Redis consideration
- **API Style**: REST endpoints with JSON responses for subtitle data
- **Performance**: Database connection pooling and query optimization

### Data Models Available
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**SubLine Table Structure:**
- id: INTEGER (Primary Key) - Unique subtitle line identifier
- movie_id: INTEGER (Foreign Key) - Links to SubTitle table movie records
- sequence: INTEGER - Line order for proper subtitle sequencing
- content: TEXT - Subtitle text content for display
- language_id: INTEGER (Foreign Key) - Language reference for subtitle content

**Related Tables:**
- SubTitle: Movie metadata with title and language information
- SubLink: Language pair relationships for subtitle availability

### API Specifications Required
[Source: architecture/data-models.md, architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Subtitle Retrieval Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/movies/{movie_id}/subtitles?lang={language_id}` - Retrieve subtitle content
  - Path parameter `movie_id` for specific movie subtitle retrieval
  - Query parameter `lang` for target language subtitle filtering
  - Response: Array of subtitle line objects with sequence and content
  - Includes caching headers for performance optimization

**Subtitle Availability Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/movies/{movie_id}/subtitles/availability` - Check subtitle availability
  - Returns available language options for specific movie
  - Used for movie catalog display and selection validation

### Database Query Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Optimized database queries for subtitle retrieval:
```sql
-- Subtitle content retrieval with proper sequencing
SELECT sl.id, sl.sequence, sl.content, sl.language_id
FROM sub_lines sl
JOIN sub_titles st ON sl.movie_id = st.id
WHERE sl.movie_id = ? AND sl.language_id = ?
ORDER BY sl.sequence ASC

-- Subtitle availability check for movie
SELECT DISTINCT sl.language_id, l.name as language_name
FROM sub_lines sl
JOIN languages l ON sl.language_id = l.id
WHERE sl.movie_id = ?
ORDER BY l.name ASC
```

### Frontend Component Specifications

- **Data Sanitization**: Sanitize subtitle content before JSON response delivery

### Form Validation Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Subtitle retrieval validation rules:
- Movie ID must be valid integer and exist in database
- Language ID must be valid and available for the specified movie
- User must have access to requested language pair combination
- Request rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Cache validation to ensure data integrity

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#movie-discovery-and-learning-session-start]
Enhanced movie selection workflow with subtitle retrieval:
1. User selects movie from catalog (existing functionality)
2. System checks subtitle availability for user's language pair
3. Subtitle content retrieved from SubLine database with caching
4. Subtitle data prepared for Epic 3 learning interface display
5. Error handling provides user feedback for missing or corrupted subtitle data
