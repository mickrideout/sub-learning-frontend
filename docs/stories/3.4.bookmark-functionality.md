## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
From Story 3.3 (User Progress Tracking System):
- UserProgress model available with session tracking and completion statistics
- Progress tracking system with alignment_index tracking functional
- SubtitlePlayer module with navigation framework and learning interface
- API authentication patterns established with @login_required decorators
- Database transaction patterns established for atomic operations
- Frontend progress tracking with alignment-based navigation integrated
- Learning interface foundation with session state management available

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Framework**: Flask 2.3.x with SQLAlchemy for bookmark persistence
- **Database**: SQLite 3.x with WAL mode for bookmark storage optimization
- **Frontend State Management**: Browser localStorage for bookmark state caching
- **API Style**: REST endpoints with JSON responses for bookmark operations
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login sessions for secure bookmark management
- **Frontend Language**: JavaScript (ES6+) for bookmark interface components

### Data Models Required
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#bookmark]
**Bookmark Model:**
- id: INTEGER (Primary Key) - Unique bookmark identifier
- user_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to users table
- sub_link_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to sub_links table
- alignment_index: INTEGER - Specific alignment pair bookmarked (index in link_data)
- note: TEXT - Optional user note about the bookmark
- created_at: DATETIME - When bookmark was created

**Frontend Bookmark Interface:**
```typescript
interface Bookmark {
  id: number;
  user_id: number;
  sub_link_id: number;
  alignment_index: number; // Index into the link_data array
  note?: string;
  created_at: string;
}
```

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
**Bookmarks Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bookmarks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    sub_link_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    alignment_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
    note TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (sub_link_id) REFERENCES sub_links(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE(user_id, sub_link_id, alignment_index)
);
```

**Required Indexes for Performance:**
- `idx_bookmarks_user` ON bookmarks(user_id)
- `idx_bookmarks_link` ON bookmarks(sub_link_id)
- `idx_bookmarks_active` ON bookmarks(user_id, is_active)

### API Specifications Required
[Source: architecture/components.md#bookmarkmanagementservice]

**POST /api/bookmarks:**
- Creates new bookmark for specific alignment with optional note
- Accepts sub_link_id, alignment_index, and optional note field
- Prevents duplicate bookmarks with unique constraint validation
- Returns created bookmark data with timestamp
- Requires user authentication via session cookies

**GET /api/bookmarks:**
- Retrieves all user bookmarks with content preview and movie titles
- Supports search query parameter for content filtering
- Includes sub_link details and alignment content preview
- Returns paginated results for performance optimization
- Requires user authentication and ownership validation

**DELETE /api/bookmarks/{bookmark_id}:**
- Removes specific bookmark by ID with user ownership validation
- Soft delete using is_active flag for audit trail
- Returns success confirmation with updated bookmark count
- Requires user authentication and ownership verification

### Frontend Component Architecture Required
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
**Bookmark Security Controls:**
- **Authentication Validation**: All bookmark endpoints require `@login_required` decorator
- **Data Ownership**: Validate user owns bookmarks before retrieval or deletion
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate alignment indices, note content, and sub_link_id values
- **Transaction Safety**: Use database transactions for bookmark operations
