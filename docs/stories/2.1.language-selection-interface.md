## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4:
- Flask-Login session management fully configured with user authentication
- User model includes native_language_id and target_language_id fields with proper foreign keys
- Authentication blueprint structure established in `app/blueprints/auth/`
- Service layer architecture pattern implemented for business logic
- Bootstrap 5.3 styling framework established for consistent UI components
- API blueprint structure established for REST endpoints
- Session-based authentication working with Flask-Login integration

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Vanilla JS + Bootstrap 5.3 for responsive language selection interface
- **Backend Framework**: Flask 2.3.x with existing blueprint architecture
- **Database**: SQLite with existing languages table and User model foreign key support
- **State Management**: Browser SessionStorage for temporary language selection state
- **API Style**: REST endpoints with JSON responses for language data retrieval

### Data Models Available
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**Languages Table Structure:**
- id: SMALLINT (Primary Key) - Unique language identifier
- name: TEXT - Internal language name
- display_name: TEXT - Human-readable language name for UI display
- code: TEXT - Language code (ISO or custom)

**User Model Language Fields:**
- native_language_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to languages table
- target_language_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to languages table
- Both fields have FOREIGN KEY constraints to languages(id)

### API Specifications Required
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
**Language Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/languages` - Get all available languages (returns array of language objects)
- `POST /api/user/languages` - Update user language preferences
  - Request body: `{native_language_id: integer, target_language_id: integer}`
  - Response: Updated user language preferences
  - Authentication: Requires session-based authentication

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#new-user-registration-with-oauth]
Language selection integration into registration flow:
1. OAuth callback creates user record without language preferences
2. Redirect new users to `/auth/language-selection` instead of dashboard
3. Language selection page displays available languages from languages table
4. User selects native and target languages with validation
5. POST to `/api/user/languages` updates user record
6. Successful update redirects to dashboard with complete user profile

### Frontend Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Language Selector Component Location:** `app/static/js/components/language-selector.js`
**Component Architecture Pattern:**
- ES6 class-based component with initialization, event binding, and API integration
- State management using SessionStorage for temporary selection state
- Bootstrap integration for responsive grid layout and form validation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages using existing error-handler utilities

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Language selection component locations:
- Route handler: `app/blueprints/auth/routes.py` (add language selection route)
- Template: `app/templates/auth/language-selection.html`
- API endpoint: `app/blueprints/api/` (extend existing API blueprint)
- Frontend component: `app/static/js/components/language-selector.js`
- Service layer: `app/services/auth_service.py` (add language update method)
- Flag images: `app/static/images/flags/` (existing directory)

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Authentication route extension: `app/blueprints/auth/routes.py`
- Language selection template: `app/templates/auth/language-selection.html`
- API language endpoints: `app/blueprints/api/` (new language endpoints)
- Language selector component: `app/static/js/components/language-selector.js`
- Auth service extension: `app/services/auth_service.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/test_integration/test_language_selection.py`

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Critical security rules for language selection:
- **Session Security**: Use Flask sessions for language selection state, never client-side storage for permanent data
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate all language ID inputs with WTForms to prevent injection attacks
- **Error Response Consistency**: All API endpoints must return JSON errors with consistent structure for frontend handling
- **Database Connection Management**: Always use SQLAlchemy context managers for database queries

### Form Validation Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Language selection validation rules:
- Both native_language_id and target_language_id must be provided (required fields)
- Language IDs must exist in languages table (foreign key validation)
- Native and target languages must be different (business rule validation)
- Language IDs must be positive integers (type validation)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location**: All tests in `tests/` directory with organized subdirectories
- **Test Framework**: pytest 7.x for backend unit and integration testing
- **Test Configuration**: Use `tests/conftest.py` for pytest configuration and fixtures
- **Test Organization**: Organize tests by component type (services, api, integration)

**Specific Requirements for Language Selection Story**:
- Test language API endpoint returns complete language data with proper structure
- Test user language update service with valid language IDs and database transactions
- Test same-language validation prevents selecting identical native and target languages
- Test language selection API endpoint with authentication and input validation
- Test integration with OAuth and email registration flows
- Test session persistence of language selections across page reloads
- Test error handling for invalid language IDs and database connection issues

**Test Organization for This Story**:
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation with solid architectural patterns and comprehensive functionality. The language selection feature is well-designed with proper separation of concerns, robust error handling, and excellent user experience. The code follows established patterns from previous stories and maintains consistency throughout the application.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `app/blueprints/api/routes.py`
  - **Change**: Refactored API endpoint to use service layer instead of bypassing it
  - **Why**: The original implementation directly modified current_user and committed to database, bypassing the AuthService validation and error handling
  - **How**: Now properly calls AuthService.update_user_languages() which provides comprehensive validation, logging, and error handling

- **File**: `app/blueprints/api/routes.py`
  - **Change**: Improved error handling for invalid JSON requests
  - **Why**: Original code would return 500 errors for malformed JSON instead of proper 400 errors
  - **How**: Added try-catch around request.get_json() to return proper 400 status with INVALID_JSON error code

- **File**: `app/models/user.py`
  - **Change**: Added relationships for efficient language queries and enhanced to_dict method
  - **Why**: No relationships meant inefficient queries; to_dict method couldn't include language details
  - **How**: Added native_language and target_language relationships with lazy loading, updated to_dict to optionally include language details

- **File**: `app/services/auth_service.py`
  - **Change**: Updated deprecated SQLAlchemy query methods
  - **Why**: Using deprecated Language.query.get() triggered warnings
  - **How**: Changed to modern db.session.get(Language, id) pattern

- **File**: `tests/test_api/test_language_endpoints.py` and `tests/test_integration/test_language_selection.py`
  - **Change**: Fixed Flask-Login session setup in tests
  - **Why**: Tests were using incorrect session key 'user_id' instead of '_user_id'
  - **How**: Updated all test session setup to use proper '_user_id' key for Flask-Login compatibility

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Follows all naming conventions, error handling patterns, and security requirements
- **Project Structure**: ✓ All files placed according to unified project structure guidelines
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage across service, API, and integration layers
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored API endpoint to use service layer properly (app/blueprints/api/routes.py)
- [x] Added efficient database relationships to User model (app/models/user.py)
- [x] Fixed deprecated SQLAlchemy query methods (app/services/auth_service.py)
- [x] Improved JSON error handling in API endpoints (app/blueprints/api/routes.py)
- [x] Fixed test authentication setup for proper Flask-Login integration
- [ ] Consider adding form-based login redirect integration tests (low priority - API tests cover core functionality)

### Security Review

✓ **Excellent security implementation:**
- All language ID inputs properly validated with WTForms-style validation
- Same-language validation prevents business logic violations
- Proper authentication checks with @login_required decorator
- Error responses follow consistent JSON structure without information leakage
- Session-based authentication properly implemented
- Input sanitization prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Well-optimized performance:**
- Languages sorted at database level, not in application
- Efficient database relationships for user language queries
- Proper use of foreign key constraints
- SessionStorage used appropriately for temporary UI state
- Database transactions properly managed in service layer

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

The language selection interface is complete, well-architected, and ready for production. All acceptance criteria are met, code quality is excellent, and the implementation follows established patterns. The refactoring I performed improves maintainability and follows senior development best practices. The comprehensive test suite provides confidence in the functionality.
