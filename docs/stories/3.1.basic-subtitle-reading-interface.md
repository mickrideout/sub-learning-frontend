**DualSubtitleDisplay Component:**

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
**New Learning Interface Files:**
- Template: `app/templates/main/learning.html` - Main learning interface page
- Route: `app/blueprints/main/routes.py` - Add `/learning/<sub_link_id>` route
- Component: `app/static/js/components/dual-subtitle-display.js` - Dual subtitle rendering
- Module: `app/static/js/modules/subtitle-player.js` - Core learning interface logic
- Styles: `app/static/css/learning.css` - Subtitle display and layout optimizations

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Critical Security Rules:**
- **Session Security**: 
  - Validate user authentication using `@login_required` decorator on learning routes
  - Check `current_user.is_authenticated` before processing requests
  - Validate session token matches user context
- **Input Sanitization**: 
  - Use Jinja2 `|e` filter for all subtitle content display: `{{ content|e }}`
  - Sanitize user preferences before localStorage storage
  - Validate all API parameters with proper type checking
- **Access Control**: 
  - Implement `verify_sub_link_access(user_id, sub_link_id)` function
  - Check user's language pair permissions in database before content delivery
  - Log access attempts for security monitoring
- **State Management**: 
  - Use Flask sessions (`session['user_id']`) for authentication state only
  - Store user preferences in localStorage with validation on retrieval
  - Never store sensitive data in client-side storage
- **Progress Tracking Atomicity**: 
  - Wrap progress updates in database transactions using `db.session.begin()`
  - Implement rollback on failure to prevent data corruption
- **Error Handling Security**:
  - Never expose database errors or internal paths to client
  - Use generic error messages for authentication failures
  - Log detailed errors server-side only

### Form Validation Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Learning Interface Validation:**
- sub_link_id must be valid integer and exist in sub_links table
- User must have access to the specific language pair (fromlang/tolang)
- Alignment index must be within bounds of available link_data array
- Font size and column width preferences must be within acceptable ranges

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#dual-language-subtitle-learning-session]
**Learning Session Workflow:**
1. User navigates from movie catalog to `/learning/{sub_link_id}` route
2. System loads link_data from SubLinkLine table for the translation pair
3. User's current progress retrieved from UserProgress table (current_alignment_index)
4. First batch of alignments (50) loaded with subtitle content from SubLine table
5. Dual-language interface displays synchronized source and target subtitle lines
6. Navigation updates progress automatically and loads additional alignments as needed

**State Management Workflow:**
- Current alignment index tracked in browser memory for immediate navigation
- Progress updates sent to server every 5 alignment advances or session change
- User preferences (font size, column width) persisted in localStorage
- Session resumption loads last accessed alignment from UserProgress table

### Memory Management Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Pi Resource Optimization:**
- Load maximum 50 alignments per API request to prevent memory exhaustion
- Cache subtitle content with TTL to balance performance and memory usage
- Use pagination for large subtitle files to maintain responsive performance
- Monitor client-side memory usage and implement cleanup for long sessions
