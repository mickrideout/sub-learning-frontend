## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2:
- Movie catalog infrastructure fully operational with `/movies` route and template
- `content_service.py` implemented with `get_available_movies` method for language pair filtering
- `movie-discovery.js` component established with movie list rendering and selection
- Bootstrap 5.3 styling framework configured for consistent UI components
- API blueprint architecture `/api/movies` endpoint working with JSON responses
- Database queries optimized for language pair filtering using sub_links JOIN
- Session-based authentication working for protected movie catalog access

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Vanilla JS + Bootstrap 5.3 for search interface enhancements
- **Backend Framework**: Flask 2.3.x with existing blueprint architecture for API endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite with existing sub_titles and sub_links tables for search queries
- **State Management**: Browser SessionStorage for search preferences and URL parameters
- **API Style**: REST endpoints with JSON responses for search results

### Data Models Available
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**SubTitle Table Structure:**
- id: INTEGER (Primary Key) - Unique movie identifier for search indexing
- title: TEXT - Movie title for search matching and display

**SubLink Table Structure:**
- id: INTEGER (Primary Key) - Unique translation link identifier
- fromid: INTEGER - Source movie ID (references sub_titles.id)
- fromlang: SMALLINT - Source language ID (references languages.id)
- toid: INTEGER - Target movie ID (references sub_titles.id)  
- tolang: SMALLINT - Target language ID (references languages.id)

**User Model Language Fields:**
- native_language_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to languages table for search filtering
- target_language_id: INTEGER - Foreign key to languages table for search filtering

### API Specifications Required
[Source: architecture/data-models.md, architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Enhanced Movie Search Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/movies?search={query}` - Movie search with language pair filtering
  - Query parameter `search` for partial title matching (case-insensitive)
  - Maintains existing language pair filtering by user's native_language_id and target_language_id
  - Joins sub_links with sub_titles for search results with subtitle availability
  - Response: Array of movie objects with id, title, and search metadata
  - Authentication: Requires session-based authentication from existing implementation

### Database Query Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Enhanced database queries for movie search:
```sql
-- Enhanced query for movie search with language pair filtering
SELECT DISTINCT st.id, st.title 
FROM sub_titles st
JOIN sub_links sl ON st.id = sl.fromid OR st.id = sl.toid
WHERE (sl.fromlang = ? AND sl.tolang = ?) 
   OR (sl.fromlang = ? AND sl.tolang = ?)
   AND LOWER(st.title) LIKE LOWER('%' || ? || '%')
ORDER BY st.title ASC
```

### Frontend Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Enhanced Movie Discovery Component:** `app/static/js/modules/movie-discovery.js`
**Search Integration Requirements:**
- Debounce implementation using setTimeout with 300ms delay for optimal UX
- URL parameter management using URLSearchParams API for bookmarkable searches
- Search result highlighting using sanitized innerHTML manipulation
- Integration with existing Bootstrap list layout and selection handling
- SessionStorage integration for search preferences persistence

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Enhanced movie catalog component locations:
- Template enhancement: `app/templates/main/movies.html` (add search bar)
- API endpoint enhancement: `app/blueprints/api/movies.py` (add search parameter handling)
- Frontend component enhancement: `app/static/js/modules/movie-discovery.js` (add search functionality)
- Service layer enhancement: `app/services/content_service.py` (add search filtering)

### File Locations for Code Enhancements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Movie catalog template: `app/templates/main/movies.html` (add search UI)
- Movie API endpoints: `app/blueprints/api/movies.py` (enhance existing endpoint)
- Movie discovery component: `app/static/js/modules/movie-discovery.js` (add search logic)
- Content service: `app/services/content_service.py` (enhance filtering method)
- Search tests: `tests/test_api/test_movie_endpoints.py` (add search test cases)

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Critical security rules for search functionality:
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate search queries to prevent SQL injection using parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: Escape user input before highlighting search results in HTML
- **Error Response Consistency**: All search API endpoints must return JSON errors with consistent structure
- **Session Security**: Use existing Flask session authentication for search access control

### Form Validation Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Search functionality validation rules:
- Search queries must be sanitized and length-limited to prevent abuse
- Search results must respect user's language pair constraints from existing filtering
- Empty search queries should default to showing all available movies for language pair
- Search input must be validated for potentially malicious content before database queries

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#movie-discovery-and-learning-session-start]
Enhanced movie discovery workflow with search:
1. User accesses movie catalog with search bar prominently displayed
2. User types search query, system debounces input and queries available movies
3. Display filtered search results with highlighted matching text
4. Maintain existing movie selection and learning session navigation
5. Preserve search query in URL for bookmarking and sharing functionality

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location**: All tests in `tests/` directory with organized subdirectories
- **Test Framework**: pytest 7.x for backend unit and integration testing
- **Test Configuration**: Use `tests/conftest.py` for pytest configuration and fixtures
- **Test Organization**: Organize tests by component type (services, api, integration)

**Specific Requirements for Movie Search Story**:
- Test enhanced movie API endpoint with search parameter functionality
- Test content service search filtering with various query patterns and edge cases
- Test frontend search component debouncing, highlighting, and URL management
