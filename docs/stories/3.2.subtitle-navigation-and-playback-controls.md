# Story 3.2: Subtitle Navigation and Playback Controls

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** language learner,  
**I want** to control the pace of subtitle progression,  
**so that** I can study at my optimal learning speed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Play/pause functionality for automatic subtitle progression with configurable timing
2. Manual navigation controls (previous line, next line) for self-paced study
3. Speed adjustment controls for automatic progression (slow, normal, fast)
4. Jump to beginning/end of subtitle file functionality
5. Keyboard shortcuts for navigation (arrow keys, spacebar) for hands-free operation
6. Current position indicator showing progress through subtitle file
7. Smooth transitions between subtitle lines without jarring interface changes
8. Pause state preservation when user navigates away and returns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
From Story 3.1 (Basic Subtitle Reading Interface):
- DualSubtitleDisplay component available with synchronized rendering
- SubtitlePlayer module established with navigation framework
- Progress tracking system integrated with UserProgress model
- Alignment data loading with pagination (50 alignments per batch)
- Keyboard navigation foundation (arrow keys) already implemented
- Current alignment highlighting and progress tracking functional

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for playback controls
- **State Management**: Browser localStorage for playback preferences persistence
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3 for responsive playback control styling
- **Animation**: CSS transitions for smooth subtitle progression
- **Timer Management**: JavaScript setInterval/setTimeout for auto-play functionality

### Data Models Required
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**UserProgress Enhancement for Playback State:**
- current_alignment_index: INTEGER - Current position maintained during playback
- session_duration_minutes: INTEGER - Automatically updated during auto-play
- last_accessed: DATETIME - Updated on pause/resume actions

**LocalStorage Schema for Playback Preferences:**
```typescript
interface PlaybackPreferences {
  isAutoPlaying: boolean;
  playbackSpeed: number; // milliseconds between alignments
  lastPlaybackState: 'playing' | 'paused';
  preferredSpeed: 'slow' | 'normal' | 'fast';
}
```

### API Specifications Required
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**No new API endpoints required** - Story builds on existing endpoints:
- `GET /api/subtitles/{sub_link_id}` - Continue using for alignment data
- `PUT /api/progress/{sub_link_id}` - Enhanced to track playback sessions
- Enhanced progress tracking frequency during auto-play (every 5 alignments)

### Frontend Component Enhancements Required
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, Story 3.1 implementation]

**SubtitlePlayer Module Extensions:**
- Add `playbackState` object to track playing/paused status
- Implement `startAutoPlay()` and `pauseAutoPlay()` methods  
- Add `setPlaybackSpeed(speed)` method for speed control
- Enhance `navigateToAlignment(index)` for jump-to functionality
- Add `savePlaybackState()` and `restorePlaybackState()` methods

**DualSubtitleDisplay Component Extensions:**
- Add transition animations for automatic progression
- Implement progress bar click-to-navigate functionality
- Enhanced progress display with alignment counters and time estimates
- Add playback control UI elements (play/pause, speed selector)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
**Enhanced Learning Interface Files:**
- Module: `app/static/js/modules/subtitle-player.js` - Add playback control methods
- Component: `app/static/js/components/dual-subtitle-display.js` - Add transition animations
- Styles: `app/static/css/learning.css` - Add playback control styling and transitions
- Utility: `app/static/js/utils/storage-helper.js` - Add playback preference management

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Playback Control Security Considerations:**
- **Input Validation**: Validate speed settings and navigation indices client-side before API calls
- **State Validation**: Verify localStorage playback preferences before applying (prevent injection)
- **Session Security**: Continue using existing `@login_required` decorator patterns
- **Progress Integrity**: Ensure auto-play progress updates use existing transaction patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Auto-play progress updates respect existing API rate limits (max 10 req/min)

### Performance Requirements  
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Pi Resource Optimization for Playback:**
- **Timer Efficiency**: Use single setInterval for auto-play, clear on pause to prevent memory leaks
- **Batch Progress Updates**: Update server progress every 5 alignments during auto-play (not every alignment)
- **Smooth Transitions**: Use CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations for better performance
- **Memory Management**: Clear playback timers on component destruction or page navigation
- **Alignment Pre-loading**: Continue using existing 50-alignment pagination during auto-play

### Keyboard Shortcut Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, extending Story 3.1 implementation]

**Enhanced Keyboard Navigation:**
- **Arrow Keys**: Left/Right for previous/next (existing functionality extended)
- **Spacebar**: Toggle play/pause for auto-progression
- **HOME/END**: Jump to beginning/end of subtitle file
- **Number Keys 1-3**: Speed selection (1=slow, 2=normal, 3=fast)
- **ESC**: Pause auto-play and return focus to manual controls
- **Enter**: Activate currently focused control element

### State Management Enhancements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Playback State Schema:**
```typescript
interface PlaybackState extends SessionState {
  autoPlay: {
    isPlaying: boolean;
    speed: number; // milliseconds
    startTime: number; // timestamp
    pausedAt: number; // alignment index
  };
  preferences: {
    defaultSpeed: 'slow' | 'normal' | 'fast';
    autoResumeOnReturn: boolean;
    showProgressDetails: boolean;
  };
}
```

**State Persistence Strategy:**
- Save playback state to localStorage on every pause/speed change
- Restore state on learning interface initialization
- Sync playback position with server progress every 5 alignments during auto-play
- Clear auto-play timers on browser tab visibility change (Page Visibility API)

## Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Manual Testing Requirements for Playback Controls:**
- **Test File Location**: All tests in `manual_tests/` directory organized by feature area
- **Test Framework**: Manual testing checklists for UI validation
- **Test Configuration**: Browser-based testing across desktop and mobile devices

**Specific Testing Requirements for Story 3.2:**
- Test auto-play functionality with all speed settings (slow, normal, fast)
- Test play/pause controls via both UI buttons and spacebar shortcut
- Test navigation shortcuts (HOME/END, arrow keys, number keys)
- Test progress indicator accuracy and click-to-navigate functionality
- Test state persistence across browser refresh and session resumption
- Test smooth transitions during automatic progression
- Test boundary conditions (auto-play at end/beginning of subtitle file)
- Test playback control integration with existing progress tracking
