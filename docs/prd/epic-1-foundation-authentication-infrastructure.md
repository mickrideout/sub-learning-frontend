# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish project setup, authentication system with email/password and OAuth integration, database foundations, and essential security infrastructure while delivering a functional user registration and login system that demonstrates core platform capabilities.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Flask Application

As a developer,
I want to establish the basic Flask project structure with essential configurations,
so that I have a solid foundation for building all subsequent features.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Flask application initialized with proper project structure (`/app`, `/static`, `/templates`, `/migrations`, `/data`)
2. Basic routing configured with health check endpoint returning system status
3. Development environment configuration with environment variables for database and secret keys
4. Version control initialized with appropriate `.gitignore` for Python/Flask projects
5. Requirements.txt file established with core dependencies (Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
6. Basic error handling middleware configured for graceful error responses
7. Application successfully runs locally with `flask run` command

## Story 1.2: Database Setup and User Model

As a system administrator,
I want the database schema and user model established,
so that user data can be stored securely and efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. SQLite database configuration with Flask-SQLAlchemy integration
2. User model defined with fields: id, email, password_hash, oauth_provider, oauth_id, created_at, updated_at
3. Database migration system configured using Flask-Migrate
4. Initial migration created and tested for user table creation
5. Database initialization script created for development setup
6. Basic database connection testing endpoint available
7. Password hashing implemented using secure algorithms (bcrypt/werkzeug)

## Story 1.3: Email/Password Authentication System

As a new user,
I want to register and login with email and password,
so that I can access the platform and maintain my learning progress.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. User registration form with email validation and password strength requirements
2. Registration endpoint creates new user with hashed password storage
3. Login form with email/password input and remember-me option
4. Login endpoint validates credentials and establishes secure session
5. Session management configured with Flask-Login for user state persistence
6. Logout functionality clears session and redirects appropriately
7. Basic user profile page displaying logged-in user information
8. Password reset functionality via email (basic implementation)

## Story 1.4: OAuth Integration for Social Login

As a busy professional,
I want to login using my Google, Facebook, or Apple account,
so that I can quickly access the platform without managing another password.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. OAuth client configuration for Google, Facebook, and Apple providers
2. OAuth login buttons prominently displayed on authentication pages
3. OAuth callback handling for successful authentication flow
4. User account creation for first-time OAuth users
5. Account linking for existing users who choose to add OAuth
6. OAuth token secure storage and session management
7. Fallback error handling for OAuth failures with clear user messaging
8. User profile indicates OAuth authentication method used
