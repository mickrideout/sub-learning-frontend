# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
Based on the Project Brief, here are the desired outcomes this PRD will deliver:

• Create a web-based dual-language subtitle learning platform that transforms passive movie watching into active language acquisition
• Enable busy professionals to combine entertainment with measurable language learning progress in 15-30 minute sessions
• Implement cognitive bridging technology that connects native and target languages through relatable movie content
• Build foundational MVP with user authentication, language pair selection, movie catalog, and synchronized subtitle display
• Establish sustainable user engagement with 70% weekly retention and 3 learning sessions per week average
• Validate market demand for movie-based language learning approach with 1,000 active users within 6 months

## Background Context

SubLearning addresses a fundamental gap in language learning where traditional materials fail to create authentic cognitive connections between textbook knowledge and real-world application. Current language learning solutions rely on artificial, scripted conversations that lack the cultural context and emotional engagement necessary for effective retention.

The platform leverages the inherent relatability of movies to create **cognitive bridges** - neurological connections between existing experience and new language concepts. By presenting dual-language subtitles side-by-side with interactive elements, SubLearning transforms entertainment consumption into structured learning opportunities that respect users' time constraints while delivering authentic cultural context and natural speech patterns that traditional methods cannot provide.
