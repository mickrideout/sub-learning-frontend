# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, distraction-free learning environment that prioritizes readability and focus. The interface should feel more like a professional learning tool than entertainment software, with intuitive navigation that doesn't interrupt the cognitive bridging process. Emphasis on text clarity, comfortable reading layouts, and seamless transitions between movie selection and subtitle study sessions.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Progressive disclosure:** Start with simple movie selection, gradually reveal subtitle controls and progress tracking
- **Keyboard-first navigation:** Arrow keys for subtitle progression, spacebar for pause/play timing, tab navigation for accessibility
- **Visual feedback system:** Subtle progress indicators and completion states without overwhelming the reading experience
- **Responsive text scaling:** User-controlled font sizing for optimal reading comfort across different screen sizes and lighting conditions

## Core Screens and Views
- **Authentication Screen:** OAuth provider buttons prominently displayed above traditional email/password form
- **Language Pair Selection:** Visual language picker with flag icons and clear native/target language designation
- **Movie Catalog Browser:** List view with alphabetical navigation sidebar and search bar for title lookup
- **Subtitle Reading Interface:** Split-screen layout with adjustable column widths, progress tracker, and bookmark functionality
- **User Progress Dashboard:** Learning statistics, bookmarked lines, and recently viewed movies

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Compliance with WCAG AA standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum), and alternative text for all interface elements. Focus indicators, skip navigation links, and semantic HTML structure throughout.

## Branding
Minimalist design aesthetic emphasizing clarity and professionalism. Color palette focused on high-contrast text readability with subtle accent colors for interactive elements. Typography choices prioritize legibility for extended reading sessions, avoiding decorative fonts that could impede learning focus.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Optimized for desktop/laptop primary usage (13-inch screens and larger) with responsive design ensuring usability on tablets and mobile devices. Desktop-first approach recognizes that extended subtitle reading is more comfortable on larger screens, while maintaining mobile compatibility for quick progress checking and light browsing.
