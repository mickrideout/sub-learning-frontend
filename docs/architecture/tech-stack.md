| Deployment - Frontend | Vercel | N/A | Next.js optimized hosting | Zero-config deployment, edge optimization |
| Deployment - Backend | DigitalOcean Droplet | N/A | Flask application hosting | Cost-effective, reliable VPS hosting |
| File Storage | Local filesystem + CDN | N/A | Static assets delivery | Direct storage with CDN for performance |
| Monitoring | Vercel Analytics + Flask logging | Built-in | Application monitoring | Frontend performance + backend logging |
| Error Tracking | Sentry | Latest | Error monitoring and alerts | Comprehensive error tracking across stack |

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Removal of Raspberry Pi Constraints

**Previous Constraint**: "Pi-optimized, no build complexity for Pi"
**New Approach**: Modern development toolchain with optimized deployment

**Rationale**: 
- Modern hosting platforms (Vercel, DigitalOcean) provide better performance and reliability
- Build tools enable significant performance optimizations
- Development experience improvements justify deployment complexity

### 2. React + Next.js Foundation

**Choice**: Next.js App Router with React Server Components
**Benefits**:
- Server-side rendering for improved SEO and initial load times
- Automatic code splitting and optimization
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Excellent developer experience with Fast Refresh

### 3. shadcn/ui Component Library

**Choice**: shadcn/ui over traditional libraries (Bootstrap, Material-UI)
**Benefits**:
- Copy-paste components for maximum customization
- Built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Tailwind CSS integration for consistent styling
- Modern design system perfect for learning applications

### 4. State Management Strategy

**Global State**: Zustand for simplicity
**Server State**: React Query for robust data management
**Form State**: React Hook Form for performance
**Local State**: React hooks (useState, useReducer)

**Rationale**: Multi-layered approach addresses different state needs without over-engineering

### 5. TypeScript Adoption

**Decision**: Full TypeScript implementation
**Benefits**:
- Catch errors at compile time
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code through types
- Easier refactoring and maintenance

## Migration Considerations

### Development Workflow Changes

**Before**: Direct file editing â†’ Upload to Pi
**After**: Modern dev workflow with:
- Local development server with hot reload
- Type checking and linting
- Automated testing
- Git-based deployment

### Performance Improvements

**Bundle Optimization**: Next.js automatically optimizes JavaScript bundles
**Image Optimization**: Built-in Next.js image optimization
**Caching Strategy**: React Query provides intelligent data caching
**Code Splitting**: Automatic route-based and component-based splitting

### Deployment Strategy

**Frontend**: Deployed to Vercel for optimal Next.js performance
**Backend**: Flask API remains on DigitalOcean droplet
**Database**: SQLite file-based database for simplicity
**Static Assets**: CDN distribution for improved global performance

This modernized tech stack provides a robust foundation for building a professional subtitle learning application while maintaining the simplicity of the backend architecture.
