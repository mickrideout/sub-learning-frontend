# Progress Indicator Manual Testing Checklist

## Story 3.2 - Progress Bar and Navigation Testing

### Test Environment Setup
- [ ] Browser: Chrome/Firefox/Safari
- [ ] Device: Desktop/Tablet/Mobile
- [ ] Test subtitle file with known alignment count (e.g., 50 alignments)
- [ ] Browser window sized to show full progress bar

## Enhanced Progress Bar Display

### Basic Progress Information
- [ ] **Alignment counter display**
  - [ ] Shows "current / total" format (e.g., "15 / 50")
  - [ ] Updates correctly when navigating with arrow keys
  - [ ] Updates correctly during auto-play
  - [ ] Shows "1 / X" when at first alignment
  - [ ] Shows "X / X" when at last alignment

- [ ] **Percentage completion**
  - [ ] Shows percentage below progress bar (e.g., "30%")
  - [ ] Calculation is accurate: (current-1) / total * 100
  - [ ] Updates in real-time during navigation
  - [ ] Shows 0% at first alignment
  - [ ] Shows 100% at last alignment

### Enhanced Progress Details

- [ ] **Time estimation during auto-play**
  - [ ] Shows "Estimated time: Xm Ys" when auto-play is active
  - [ ] Calculation uses current speed setting
  - [ ] Updates as alignment progresses
  - [ ] Shows "--" when auto-play is paused
  - [ ] Shows "Complete!" when reaching end

- [ ] **Time estimation accuracy**
  - [ ] For slow speed (5s): verify calculation (remaining × 5 seconds)
  - [ ] For normal speed (3s): verify calculation (remaining × 3 seconds)  
  - [ ] For fast speed (1s): verify calculation (remaining × 1 second)
  - [ ] Updates immediately when speed is changed

## Clickable Progress Bar Navigation

### Click-to-Navigate Functionality
- [ ] **Basic click navigation**
  - [ ] Clicking left side of progress bar jumps to earlier alignment
  - [ ] Clicking right side jumps to later alignment
  - [ ] Clicking center jumps to middle alignment
  - [ ] Current alignment updates to match click position

- [ ] **Visual feedback for interactivity**
  - [ ] Progress bar shows hover state (slight scale up)
  - [ ] Cursor changes to pointer when hovering
  - [ ] Click action feels responsive (immediate jump)

- [ ] **Accuracy of click positioning**
  - [ ] Click at 0% jumps to first alignment (1 of X)
  - [ ] Click at 100% jumps to last alignment (X of X)
  - [ ] Click at 50% jumps to middle alignment (approximately)
  - [ ] Calculation: Math.floor(clickPosition × totalAlignments)

### Click Behavior During Auto-Play
- [ ] **Auto-play interruption**
  - [ ] Clicking progress bar pauses auto-play
  - [ ] Jumps to clicked position
  - [ ] Play button returns to "Play" state
  - [ ] Speed setting is preserved for next play

- [ ] **State consistency after click**
  - [ ] Progress details update to reflect new position
  - [ ] Time estimate recalculates from new position
  - [ ] All UI elements sync to new alignment

## Progress Bar Visual Design

  - [ ] Touch targets are appropriate size
  - [ ] Text remains readable at smaller sizes

- [ ] **Mobile view**  
  - [ ] Progress bar is still functional for touch
  - [ ] Progress details may stack or resize appropriately
  - [ ] No critical information is hidden

### Visual State Indicators

  - [ ] Text contrast is sufficient for readability
  - [ ] Hover effects are subtle but noticeable

- [ ] **Animation and transitions**
  - [ ] Progress updates with smooth animation
  - [ ] Click navigation shows smooth transition to new position
  - [ ] No jarring jumps or visual glitches

## Integration with Other Features

### Navigation Button Synchronization
- [ ] **Button state updates**
  - [ ] Previous button disabled when at first alignment
  - [ ] Next button disabled when at last alignment  
  - [ ] First/Last buttons disabled at respective boundaries
  - [ ] Button states update when using progress bar clicks

### Auto-Play Integration  
- [ ] **During auto-play**
  - [ ] Progress bar updates smoothly during automatic advancement
  - [ ] Time estimates countdown correctly
  - [ ] No conflicts between progress updates and user interaction

- [ ] **Speed change effects**
  - [ ] Time estimates update immediately when speed changes
  - [ ] Progress bar animation speed remains consistent
  - [ ] No calculation errors during speed transitions

## Keyboard Accessibility

### Progress Bar Keyboard Support
- [ ] **Tab navigation**
  - [ ] Progress bar can receive keyboard focus
  - [ ] Focus indicator is clearly visible
  - [ ] Tab order is logical in relation to other controls

- [ ] **Keyboard activation**
  - [ ] Enter key can activate progress bar at current focus
  - [ ] Arrow keys can fine-tune position when focused
  - [ ] ESC key returns focus to main interface

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Boundary Conditions
- [ ] **Empty or minimal data**
  - [ ] Progress bar handles 1 alignment gracefully
  - [ ] Shows appropriate state for minimal data sets
  - [ ] No division by zero errors in calculations

- [ ] **Loading states**
  - [ ] Progress bar shows appropriate placeholder during loading
  - [ ] No flashing or error states during data fetch
  - [ ] Graceful transition when data becomes available

### Click Edge Cases

  - [ ] No lag during progress bar interaction
  - [ ] Smooth performance with large alignment counts

### Memory and CPU Usage
- [ ] **Progress updates**

  - [ ] Focus changes are communicated clearly
  - [ ] Error states are announced if they occur

## Data Accuracy Verification

### Manual Calculation Verification
- [ ] **Test with known data set**
  - [ ] Load subtitle with exactly 20 alignments
  - [ ] Verify alignment 10 shows "10 / 20" and "50%"
  - [ ] Click at 25% should jump to alignment 5
  - [ ] Click at 75% should jump to alignment 15

- [ ] **Time estimation verification**
  - [ ] At alignment 10 of 20, with 3s speed, should show ~30s remaining
  - [ ] Verify calculation manually: (20-10) × 3 = 30 seconds
  - [ ] Test different speeds and positions
